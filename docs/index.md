The easiest way to use a production version of Beamify is to use the [Beamify](https://beamify.me) website, it comes fully configured with all the tools available. Our application is designed
to be deployed with minimal effort, you only have to configure the environment variables and you are ready to go.

We want to provide a multifunctional ERP/CRM that covers a variety of use cases, from small businesses to large enterprises. From hobbies to professional services, we have a solution 
for every need and built into a single platform.

You can access the documentation by running the following command:

```bash
nx run master:hads
```
This will open a new tab in your default browser with the documentation.

```html
http://localhost:4040
```
 If you are using the NX Console, you can also run the command which is in 'projects/master/hads'.
